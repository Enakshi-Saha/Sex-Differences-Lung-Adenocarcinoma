# Gene Regulatory Networks Reveal Sex Differences in Lung Adenocarcinoma

This repository contains code for replicating the analysis presented in the paper "Gene Regulatory Networks Reveal Sex Differences in Lung Adenocarcinoma": doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.559001

## Discovery Data
Uniformly processed RNA-Seq data were downloaded from the Recount3 database for two discovery datasets on May 26, 2022: (i) healthy lung tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project (version 8) and (ii) lung adenocarcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Clinical data for GTEx were obtained from the dbGap website (https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) under study accession phs000424.v8.p2. Clinical data for TCGA were accessed from Recount3.

## Validation Data
Two independent studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used as validation datasets: GSE47460 (or, LGRC) and GSE68465. From the LGRC (downloaded on Feb 12, 2023) data, we used 108 samples (59 female and 49 male) annotated as “control” samples for validation.
